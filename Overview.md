Its a decentralized(I) exchange on multiplayer mode.


# Exchange

### Fiat

With growing crypto markets fiat is one of the first priority as its the gateway to enter into crypto markets.

### Fees

Fees are necessary or else bots will trade buy and sell at lowest decimal with ever increasing profits.
Fees will be dynamic based how much you trade. We will use machine learning to determine how much fees you will be charged. 
It won't be as simple as more frequent you trade less fees you will be charged to prevent bot abuse.

### Bot Marketplace

There will be bot marketplace where anyone can rent bots and trade within the exchange.

Stop Loss bot , Stop Profit bot and some basic bots will be added for free.

For example someone can create a "trending" bot and use twitter api to determine which coins are trending and trade it for you when youre sleeping.

### Voting

Community will be allowed to vote to make certain decisions.

### Trading Contests

There will be weekly trading contests and winners will be awarded . Each contest details will be specific to when it will be anounced.

### Referrals

You will be paid a percent of daily fees of your referrals both directly and indirectly.

###  Holding

We will rewards holders proportionally with percent of daily fees of total volume.

### Selling Data

Our API will charge external third party that cross free rate-limit. If you opt in to sell your data you will recieve a percent of fees.

# Social (II)

###  Portfolio

You can exactly see portfolio, trade history, trade signals of people in real time.

### Signals

Intead of getting signals in telegram and twitter you can directly follow people and get notified or automatically trade their signals.
The people can decide to get paid periodically, one time, percent of profits or free.
This will prevent things like pump and dump you can exactly see when the person buys his own signal, how much he does, when his other group members bought , when they sold.

### Microblogging

Minimilastic version of Twitter.

### Trade Lending

People will be able to lend money which will be kept inside exchange and will be paid percentage of profits. The first batch will have to go through strict KYC and rest will be network effects as the exchange grows. For example you dont need to do KYC but can get verified by someone who has a KYC or get verified by a verified person who got verified by a KYC verified person and so on. Its absolutely recommended to verify a person whom you know personally and can payout the loan. 

### Coop Trading

You can give your money to a professional trader who can trade it and give you profits. The trader can get paid periodically, one time, percent of profits or free. The money will be completely safe as it will be locked by contract and only you can withdraw it but the trader can obviously cause a loss so you have to know whom youre going to allow trading for you. Features like hardstop can allow you to set a stop so trader can't sell below a certain threshold.

### Reputations

People who give profitable signals, rent profitable bots and payout lends will get reputations. You can use reputation points to determine whom you can trust and whom not . Reputations points will depend on factor of things like amount, payout time, profits made. Thus we will be able to create a system where we can match the potential borrowers/traders that suite your needs.


(I) There will also be a centralised part of exchange and there are good reasons for it.
Decentralized exchanges are really slow. People don't want to wait minutes for a order to complete. You can't do high speed trading on a decentralized exchanges (as of 2017). The coins with huge demand and volume will be also added on centralised part of exchange.

(II) - You can completely/partially disable the social part and only trade solo anonymously.
